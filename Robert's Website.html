        <h2>About This Map</h2>
        <p>The places on this map hold significant importance for me because I either pass by or interact with each of them in some way or another. For example, my family has been going to Bagels N’ Buns and Wiesner’s Nursery for years now and know the staff there well. Bagels N’ Buns has become such a routine part of my day and walk that I just had to include it on my map. I am always walking by and picking up something for myself or my family and have been doing so for years. As for Wiesner, my family has been using their services ever since I was little. Our backyard is filled with beautiful trees planted by them, but even more significantly, my family gets a Christmas tree from them every year and the whole picking out a Christmas tree process has always been fun even to this day! The library and Gaeta Park also hold special memories for me as well from my childhood and it is always nice to pass by both on some of my walks! Gaeta Park, while it may be small, is special to me because my dad used to bring me there often to just hang out or throw a ball around and so I am always reminded of those times with him whenever I pass by and those are memories that I will cherish forever. As for the library, my elementary school used to take us on trips there quite often for a bunch of different events and I always used to check out a book while I am there and it is this library that really sparked my interest in reading, a hobby that I enjoy to this day!  Regarding the Clove Lakes area, that whole park is special to me as my family used to take me there to either go fishing or ice skating or for walks ever since I was little. The restaurant within Clove Lakes, The Stone House, is very special to me as many of my accomplishments were celebrated in that restaurant. I am always reminded of events such as my Confirmation, Communion, and graduation whenever eating at that restaurant because my family planned nice parties for those events, and it was always a very nice time to be there. The ice-skating rink and baseball field are also important because whenever I pass by, I am reminded of my childhood of playing baseball and practicing with my team at that field. The ice-skating rink always reminds me of visiting the park during the winter season and being with tons of family and friends while skating around or playing in the snow as a kid. Both places are important to me as they remind me of the wonderful childhood that I had. Finally, Stonehenge is a place that is very important to me, simply for its’ beauty during spring. In Spring, the cherry blossom trees surrounding the building are in full bloom and it is always such a pretty sight to see when passing by on my walks.</p>
        <p>During this semester, I learned so much about GIS. I learned about how in depth one can go in making maps and about the numerous tools available to fit all kinds of needs. One thing that I found really interesting about GIS is all the different map forms available to construct your map and how detailed you can get with making such creations. I will definitely continue to use GIS in the future because it was honestly a lot of fun. I went from having no experience with map making tools to now being able to construct all sorts of maps about the areas I am interested in! I plan on using GIS to fine tune some of the earlier maps I made and to explore other areas where my family is from and learn more about the land there and how it has changed since then!</p>
